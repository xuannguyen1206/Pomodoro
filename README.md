# final committment
## How it works: 
at start, app will wait for backend (files in API folder of NEXT) to scrape the web https://colorhunt.co for color palettes, thus color button will be loading, when new colors are ready, the color button will stop loading.

### clock:
* color button: change the color based on theme set by darkmode value.
* shuffle button: change the current colors into different places of the app
* countdown
* can set preference time in time setting by opening with clicking the cog image
* stop and play as please
* play sound cue when time is up
* a circle animation to present the process of time

### time setting:
- Set time and color theme
- if time is not legitimate, a warning will pop up with clear instruction
- Dark mode is used to control the theme for th up coming color provided by the color button.
- Hit apply to save configuration, if not all changes will be loss.

### taskbar:
* Automatically switch task when time is up
* Can manually switch task, this will automatically reset the time

### apple counter:
* Automatically add when pomodoro time is up
* Can manually control the number of apples
